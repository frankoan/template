			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>This paper is a formal research paper on the field of study that I have chosen to be my major. My major is mechanical engineering. In this paper I will give background information about my major. Information such as starting, and average salary to show what type of life style it brings. Furthermore, I will give information on the type of communication that takes place within that major. I will go into detail on the importance of communication in the field of engineering and what style of writing it is. I will also talk about the importance of technology and how it has changed the way mechanical engineers go to work. Also elaborate on how it will continue to change the workplace. Lastly, I will talk about how research is done today with programs such as CAD, and how research has become a small step process instead of a large step process.</p>
