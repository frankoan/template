<h1>Blog #1</h1>                        
<p>The purpose of the video was to reach out into the gay communtiy and let everyone know who thinks that they are in the dark, that they are not alone in the world. That there are people out there who are just like you. Who are facing the same challenges that you are. There is help available to you so you don't end up like another statistic. That you are perfect the way you are. That the life that you are living is perfectly normal and that you will find happiness if you think that you are left out in the dark. That this is not the end of the line it is only the beginning of something new</p>
<p>The video attempts to achieve its purpose in the manner of how it is shown. In the beginning it is very dark as it displays the story of how his uncle Ronnie was gay. He was left out. He was getting divorced and he had no where to turn. He killed himself because of this. It then shows Randy. Randy is also gay and he is in the same situation as uncle Ronnie. Randy reads a letter that he wrote to his uncle Ronnie about all of the pain and suffering that his death caused him. How he is in the exact same position as Ronnie was. How he may loses his kids and that no one will love him. How he now is left in the dark without a shoulder to cry on. But he finishes it by saying he will not be the same statistic that uncle ronnie was. He will not commit suicide but he will strive above it and reach out to all those that are feeling that same way.</p>
<p>The message is structured into three parts. The first part is very silent as the story of Uncle Ronnie is told to show that this was a very tragic event. The next part is when we meet Randy who shares with us his letter to his Uncle Ronnie. Shares us the pain of how he felt about Ronnie's actions and how he himself is like uncle Ronnie. Then lastly he brightens up the dark mode by saying everything is alright and that there is help out there for everyone and that you are fine the way you are.</p>
<p>This will help me review my Lived Experienes Project because it shows a way to show how to put forward a lived experience. It shows how experiences in life can really push you to do things. It shows how to push the idea in a manner that moves or at least shows the point of the written story.</p>
