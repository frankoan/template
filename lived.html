		<h1>Lived Experiences Project</h1>
		<p>Everyone has an intended career path in life. This career path is usually chosen due to an experience or an event in the childhood of that person. My expected career path is to graduate from the college of engineering here at Michigan State with a degree in mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering is field that has multiple areas that you can go into such as automotive, aerospace, industrial, naval, etc. For the most part, if it moves it was helped put together and designed by a team of mechanical engineers. Mechanical engineering is also one of the oldest engineering degrees available.  Since the industrial revolution, mechanical engineering has played an important role designing new machines and technology. The field of mechanical engineering deals with a wide range of core courses such as mathematics, mechanics, thermodynamics, materials science, etc.  These courses also are paired with computer skills. Today, computer design has really come into use by all mechanical engineers. A lot of work is being done in computer programs such as CAD. This simply stands for computer animated design. These CAD programs allow mechanical engineers to draft out parts and then run and simulate tests on these parts digitally to see their failing points. This allows the companies that these engineers work for to save money and time on building the prototype knowing that on most levels that the part that was designed will meet its specific design requirements. It is also a very demanding degree program to get into. Upper level classes in the college of engineering are demanding in the amount of time and effort that you have to put forth in order just to get a decent grade in the class.</p>
		<p>The object that got me into the idea of becoming a mechanical engineer was my Huffy mountain bike. It was a newer bike; I had gotten it that year for Christmas. I really liked to ride that bike and did so any chance that I could get. I would ride it up the street to the corner store or to my friend’s house in the neighborhood.  It was a red bike with some rust on the frame because I had left it out in the rain a couple times. The gears despite being not even a year old had been worn down since I rode it every day. It definitely had a ton of miles on it. It was because of that bike, when I first realized that mechanical engineering was the field that I wanted to get into.</p>
		<p>This career path was chosen because of an event in my past in which that red huffy bike played a large role. I was ten years old when this experience happened but it was the first time I thought that I would like to grow up and build stuff. It was a hot summer day, and my mom went out shopping leaving me in the care of my older brother. I was riding my bike when I decided to ghost ride it down the drive way. If you are not sure what ghost riding is, it is when you get your bike going fast and hop off of it and let it go by itself with no rider. The only problem was that today my bike veered off of the path that I had intended it to go. The bike hit a rock took a nice jump and then smacked right into the community mail box. The bike then broke into pieces as the screws holding the steering assembly and gear assembly had been rusted they sheared in half. It was a very disheartening sight to see my bike fall apart like it did that day. This wasn’t good because I thought my mom was going to kill me. So, I picked up all of the parts and put them in the garage. I grabbed the tool kit in the garage and a bunch of boxes of screws. My brother came out and laughed at me like a brother would and then decided to help me out. My brother and I slowly piece by piece figured out how to put that bike back together. It definitely wasn’t a great job when we got all the parts back on the bike mainly because the screws that we used to put it back together were not completely identical to the ones that broke off. They did the job for the time being as my mom would be home any minute from the grocery store and I didn’t want to get grounded. To see if it even still worked I rode it around the cul de sac.  I found out that it wouldn’t shift properly and that you couldn’t turn the wheel well, so you had to lean into every turn. The important thing about it was that it looked as if nothing had happened to it. It had some new scrapes on the frame from the pavement, but unless you looked closely to see all of the newly replaced screws that were way too big for the screw holes. When my mom came back and saw the tools out she was suspicious of something but my brother covered for me. When she walked past the bike she didn’t notice the bike at all. I gave a great sigh of relief that I was going to be grounded or in trouble at all. I got out with no punishment but my bike wasn’t in the greatest working condition by a long shot.</p>
		<p>It was because of that bike incident that I had, that really made me choose my specific career path of mechanical engineering when I frantically put my bike back together. That really made me wonder what else could I build and really got me to take up the major that I did. I wanted to design new things and improve on the old things just like how I did chores to get the money to buy new parts for my bike. I rebuilt the bike with those new parts and created a bike that lasted me all the way up until college when I finally had to replace it for a new one because the frame became too old. The welds began to crack and break. That is the lived experience that got me to decide to come to Michigan State University to study to become a mechanical engineer.</p>
