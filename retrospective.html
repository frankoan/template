		<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
		<p>In this paper it will tell you how to be successful in WRA 110 and how to create good material to get a good grade in class. WRA 110 is a first year writing course here at Michigan State University. Writing is a required class here at Michigan State as one of your general education courses. Like all courses each one varies in topics that you will write about. Some of these courses will have you writing about everything from culture, to the zombie apocalypse, to this class which is about science and technology. In these courses you will learn the basics on how to write a good paper and the mechanics behind it no matter the topic as these courses revolve around them. Things like invention, revision, types of writing styles, etc. are all taught in the course. Like all courses each has their tricks to get a good grade in the class. For the most part the main thing is to not procrastinate in this class. It seems very easy to because you only meet one day a week and the truth is that it is very easy to put the papers off. That is not a good idea because you will keep putting it off to the last minute and then be forced to crank out the paper in a night which will lead to a bad grade for that paper. With the papers being worth from ten percent to twenty percent of your grade having one bad paper can really tank your grade. So good advice would be to get everything done when you have class time to do it or work on it when you need a break from another class. This way you will not have to rush it.  But other than the papers there are other parts to the course and this paper will go through all of them giving you an idea of what they are about. </p>
		<p>The course of WRA 110 is one that consists of many parts to the class and each one has their own problem that you need to research or fix. The course consists of four papers outside of this one. It also has a documentary in the remix project that is about one of the past papers. There are also other assignments to the class like in class assignments, or homework assignments like you blog, Codecademy, and activities outside the five papers. This makes it key to look at your schedule to find out what is due in class each day to make sure you do not get behind, but now here are all of the parts of the course.</p>
		<p>The first thing that I will go over is the blog. The blog is a chance to post how you feel throughout the course. Like what you like about your paper or something that comes to mind that pertains to class. This blog is important to keep up on because your final paper in the class is the paper you are reading right now where you talk about what you should do in WRA 110 to be successful. The reason why the blog is so helpful is because you can read about what your thoughts were about a specific paper when you were working on it and can remember what you would have done differently. The blog is on your github page that your instructor will help you set up. I liked the blog in the manner that it really allowed you to keep track of what you thought about a current assignment and your mood towards it. It gave you an opportunity to really see where the basis for your invention and research that you used to write the paper. </p>
		<p>Now for the first paper which was the Lived Experiences Project. In this project you thought of an item that affected what you wanted to be in the future. This project took some deep thinking because you had to find that one day in your history where something happened that involved an object that became the basis for you current career choice. It for me was a project that I really enjoyed. My object was my bike that fell apart after I crashed it and I had to put it together before my mom got home. This project makes you think of that object that made you pick your career choice. With that object in mind you have to think of the story behind that object. You then have to think of a good way to tell that story to show everyone why this event made you want to be who you are. The key to this though was connecting that object to your story without going into a multitude of detail that would make your story go on forever as each paper has a maximum and minimum word count. With this project also came a drafting activity. These activities are times where you can really think of a way to make this paper. It really helps you get a head start of the project and get your thoughts on the same page. For the most part there is a drafting activity with most of the papers. </p>
		<p>The next project in the class is the cultural analysis paper. In this paper you find an issue within society that is caused by technology. To do this you really have to look at things that people do and why. For my topic I picked smartphones and their negative impacts on society.  This project is another that really made you think because you had to think of a problem that people were doing and write about why this is a problem. Once you have defined the problem at hand you then need to come up with creative solutions on how to fix this problem. There was a drafting activity to help you get started. Another thing that helped me out was what we did in class. We watched an episode of South Park that was making fun of world of Warcraft. This helped because we had to analysis the problem that they were making fun of in the show. They brought up saying that if you play world of Warcraft you have no lift. Now this isnâ€™t true but because of videogames people are not being as social as they would be without them and are becoming addicted to them. </p>
		<p>The third paper of the course was the formal research paper. For this paper you had to take your specific major and analysis it in depth. This means that you really have to look at what you really want to do and what does it mean to do it. This project was more challenging than the prior two papers that we had written. You also had to do a lot more research for this paper and you had to conduct interviews on someone who practices that specific degree and a professor or grade student in that degree as well. The drafting activity associated with this project really was not about helping you start you draft but to get your research started. You had to look through a given website and get a total of four sources and then look through them and see what about them you can use. This also helps you learn how to narrow down your search. This way you can find the information that you want and keep a lot of the useless information out of the way. I thought that this was very helpful because in a research paper the hardest part is finding your sources and making sure that the information that they provide will help you write the paper. Once you have found your sources then the paper becomes a lot easier and now you just need to come up with a way to efficiently write your information in a manner that flows nicely. </p>
		<p>The second to last project that we had done is the remix project. This project is where we take on project that we had done earlier in the year and make a documentary about it. This time the project was a group project. For this project you have to think about your papers as a group and decide which one to pick. You then need to re-research the project and come up with enough information to create a seven to eight minute movie about the problem. To help it come together you have to do a proposal where you have to define the problem and all of the steps that you will take in your documentary to show this problem. To get another idea about how to do this we watched the documentary show called ancient aliens were you can see that the show has a way that information is given to you so the documentary sucks you in and makes you scratch your head and wonder how. That is what your documentary had to try and have this drawing effect were you want to watch the whole thing because you find it so interesting. </p>
		<p>The last paper is the course retrospect paper. In this paper you will reflect on the year that has just gone by and create advice for people who are about to take the course. This is in the idea that if someone were to read your paper then they would be well prepared for the course and be able to get a good grade. This is where your blog comes in handy as you can reference it to get your thoughts on each paper as you wrote it giving you better insight on it. </p>
		<p>Lastly, you have Codecademy. This is something that you do on your own time that has to be completed by the end of the semester. This is a very important part of the class because it teaches you how to code html. This is very important because on github.com you have your portfolio that consists of your papers and you blog. Codecademy will help you to put your papers online and everything that goes with them like pictures, and videos depending on the project. It will also tell you how to change the CSS on your page which is a requirement before turning in your portfolio. So with all of that in mind it is better that you complete Codecademy earler in the year so you do not have to cram but also you can easily put everything online giving you a good grade as they have to be online when you submit them as well. I hope that this will give you some good insight on the class and allow you to get a good grade in the class.  </p>
