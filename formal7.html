			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, mechanical engineering is a degree that is very general. For the most part if it moves a mechanical engineer had something to do with it. With that comes a specialization in mathematics, physics, materials science, etc. In the business world communication is very important as well as team building skills. The communication is very technical with very short and sweet memos to tell you what next is needed to be done. Technology has changed the way a lot over the years and so has how the degree is practiced. Large departments are now condensed into teams and the deadlines have been condensed with them. It is also apparent that technology will continue the trend of constant change in my lifetime as a mechanical engineer. A degree that I feel is a perfect fit for me and will continue to study it. </p>
