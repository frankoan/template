			<h1>Technology Section</h1>
			<p>Another impact that technology has had an impact on is in the field of research and development. Technology has impacted research in many ways. It has also developed parallel to the computer’s ability to process more and more data at a time. As computers got better and better the time that projects where given to be done shrank. As stated before in the mid-60s the average time frame for the research and development of a car or a mainframe computer was around six years. With the development of technology the period for the same project compressed to two years and for other project they stand around the six months’ time. This is due to there now being multiple computer programs out there that you can build and research on (Bar-Cohen). Programs such as CAD for example that stands for computer assisted design. Computer assisted design is a program that allows you to draw and create your parts digitally. This provides great accuracy in measurements that parts need to be. But that is not all that it does. You can take the part and put it into a certain file or function and send that file to different machines that can process the file like a CNC machine. CNC stands for computer numerical control. These machines can take the information from the CAD documents and overlay that information over a surface in the machine and it will create that part by following the numbers given to the machine. This allows for easier manufacture of prototype parts speeding up the process (Ryan). </p>
			<p>These computer programs can also help with final assembly. With programs such as CAD you can create the parts and fit them together in the actual program which will help with the final assembly. Also in some of these programs in computers can actually test the parts and see if it will handle the stresses that it is designed to hold. Mr. Franko says that the programs used at his work can test a robot and simulate the process at the actual speed of the robot arm. Will this is happening it will give you measurements on the amount of torque and the high stress areas in the process. All of this speeds up the design times and is a reason why certain departments have shrank into only small teams of engineers. </p>
