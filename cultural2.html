			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Every culture has something that gives it its identity. This can vary from generation to generation and even from century to century. It could be something as in architecture, art, music, scientific and technological breakthroughs. These are the things that can identify a culture at a specific time. The time the breakthrough happened and its impact on the population this new item caused can all be traced. For instance the Roman Empire is related to the arch which allowed the building of aqueducts, which lead to the building of large cities such as Rome. In the mid-1800s it was the train that allowed the continental United States to be connected from sea to sea. This revolutionized travel. The next revolutions were flight, the internet and so on. Each of these had their own specific contribution and effect on society. Today the device that has had the most effect on the world population is a device that you use every day. It really has become an item that you cannot leave your house without. It is your smart phone which has really had one of the biggest effects on a world population. It can be seen being sold everywhere from the United State to Europe, Asia, etc. This is also a light years advance from a short time period of twenty years ago where the smart phone did not exist and the average cell phone was only for the wealthy. They were bulky and expensive and now smart phones are small sleek hand held computers with a multitude of purposes. But with every technological advance they do have some negative effects on the population. The smart phone has caused a negative effect on the social skills on my generation as well as the way we learn and memorize material.</p>
