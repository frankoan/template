			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Now here comes the negative effects that have been spotted as a result of the advances in these phones connect ability between one another. For instance, if you were to go to a restaurant and look around on your average Saturday what would you see a lot of?  You would see a lot of the teenagers at the tables and even some of the parents on their smart phones checking up on the next update looking at email, or texting a friend. They could be checking Facebook or Twitter you really have no way of knowing but they do not contribute to the conversation at hand. This is one of the growing social problems that are being noticed in young adults as well as teenagers.  The newest generation is having a fall in face to face social skills that this is a result of the smart phone. You really do not have to have a face to face conversation with someone anymore. All you have to do is text them or message them over a social network.  It really is amazing how you can talk to people and never actually meet them face to face. This seems like a good thing because you can always have someone to talk to but the problem is that you are not having a face to face conversation. Really what this shows is today’s connectivity but the problem is that connectivity is having an effect on the social skills of the up and coming.</p>
			<p>The reason is that you do not have to talk to people up front but instead through a phone. This provides a disconnect between you and the person you are talking to. You are having a conversation but are in total having a disconnect as you cannot really tell emotion, tone, have eye contact, or other parts of a face to face conversation. This causes the person who is used to these disconnected conversations to become very nervous and uneasy in face to face conversations with people that they have no prior relations with. They feel awkward and uneasy in trying to create a new conversation with someone they do not know.  They do not learn the correct way to speak to someone in an interview for example. Not only are they looking at your resume but they are looking at you responsiveness of the questions you ask as well as you way of answering them.  Another example would be to walk through your average high school and you can see people texting each other on opposite sides of the hallway. Or you could have kids next to each other but instead to talking to each other they are attempting to beat their high score on Flappy Bird.</p>
			<p>Another issue that smart phones are having on the current generation is how we memorize the knowledge that is learned in school. Your brain is basically a biological computer that can store and interpret information through electric impulses. It also is like in a computer in the sense that it has long term and short term memory. The social issue that is tied to your memory is how you memorize the facts, formulas, readings, lectures, etc.  For example, if you use a formula a lot you will memorize it after a while because it is a part of your long term memory. But if it is a fact that you might need to know in the future but you do not use it a lot you most likely will not remember it because you can simply take out your phone and look it up on the internet when it is necessary. This is something that every student does and it is effecting students in the manner that after they take a test they forget about the information that they learned in a couple of months. They can get away with this because of the internet and a student’s ability to access it almost anywhere. </p>
