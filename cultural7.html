			<p>All in all, smart phones are an amazing piece of technology that can have so many uses and are used daily by people around the world. They have amazing possibilities and can allow an unlimited amount of information and connectivity through the internet. With this come social issues such as not being able to interact in face to face conversation as well as not committing learned information into long term memory instead of short term. All because you talk to people only through a phone or for the second issue you can just look it up later off your phone when you need to. In overview, smart phones are changing and so it our society along with it and with any change there are some side effects that come along with them. These social issues are one of the side effects created by the change the smart phone has created on our society.</p>
