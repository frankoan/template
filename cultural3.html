			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>Before I go into the negative effects that smart phones have created in the new generation that is currently moving forward I will talk about a little information about them. If you are reading this then you probably have a smart phone. If you do not have one then in five years you will most likely have one. As the phones become more advanced and the networks become more advanced, the prices of todayâ€™s smart phones in 5 years will be close to the discount phones you can get off cell phone carriers websites today. For instance look at the progress of the IPhone made by the Apple Incorporate over the last 5 years. They have jumped milestones and other bounds that no one really would have even really thought was possible twenty years ago. Imagine what another five years could bring forth. Other smart phone designers are Samsung, Microsoft, etc. are all in pursuit of having the dominate phone on the market. But it is the features that these phones offer that are causing the current social issues at hand. Some features are things such as games, music, TV, etc. that can allow us to connect to our favorite show or song.  Other features are social media apps such as Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat , Vine, that are all keeping use connected to our friends and family like nothing ever before. You can see and send pictures, talk, make events all with the touch of a finger. You can call people and send text messages to these people on you contact list furthering your ability to communicate with them. The biggest part of these smart phones is their ability to connect to the internet. This allows apps like Facebook to update and send pictures and messages. You can look up just about anything you want from these smart phones if you did not know something off the top of your head. They really are a technological masterpiece and they are getting better and faster. They are also very simple to use. For example, my cousin is a little under three years old and she can use her parents IPhone 5. She can unlock it go through pictures, take pictures, play games, etc. It really is amazing to watch her do all of this.</p>
