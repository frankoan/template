      <p>Not really sure how this class this year really is going to turn out. I really do not know a how bunch about the html or how to use it but im sure that after this class is over and all of the papers are done I will be able to do a lot on the computer and probably be just about able to make my own website. It will probably be a tin of work but im sure that I will be able to do it. I hope for another great semester of classes here at State.</p>
    <h1>Blog #2</h1>                        
  <p>The purpose of the video was to reach out into the gay communtiy and let everyone know who thinks that they are in the dark, that they are not alone in the world. That there are people out there who are just like you. Who are facing the same challenges that you are. There is help available to you so you don't end up like another statistic. That you are perfect the way you are. That the life that you are living is perfectly normal and that you will find happiness if you think that you are left out in the dark. That this is not the end of the line it is only the beginning of something new</p>
  <p>The video attempts to achieve its purpose in the manner of how it is shown. In the beginning it is very dark as it displays the story of how his uncle Ronnie was gay. He was left out. He was getting divorced and he had no where to turn. He killed himself because of this. It then shows Randy. Randy is also gay and he is in the same situation as uncle Ronnie. Randy reads a letter that he wrote to his uncle Ronnie about all of the pain and suffering that his death caused him. How he is in the exact same position as Ronnie was. How he may loses his kids and that no one will love him. How he now is left in the dark without a shoulder to cry on. But he finishes it by saying he will not be the same statistic that uncle ronnie was. He will not commit suicide but he will strive above it and reach out to all those that are feeling that same way.</p>
  <p>The message is structured into three parts. The first part is very silent as the story of Uncle Ronnie is told to show that this was a very tragic event. The next part is when we meet Randy who shares with us his letter to his Uncle Ronnie. Shares us the pain of how he felt about Ronnie's actions and how he himself is like uncle Ronnie. Then lastly he brightens up the dark mode by saying everything is alright and that there is help out there for everyone and that you are fine the way you are.</p>
  <p>This will help me review my Lived Experienes Project because it shows a way to show how to put forward a lived experience. It shows how experiences in life can really push you to do things. It shows how to push the idea in a manner that moves or at least shows the point of the written story.</p>

  <p>The Lived Experience project is a good paper because it really makes you think about where and when you really got the idea to take the major that you did. Like all things their is always something behind your decision that backs you up on your choice whether a sorry that involves an object or a conversation you had with a family member that is in a field like the one you choose. For this project you had to find the object that made you want to become the major that you did. For me it was breaking my bike and putting it back together that really made me think that engineering would be the career for me. Another thing that helped was I was good at math and found all of my science classes very interesting so the field of engineering really was a great choice for me. So far I like it a lot but school will soon get very hard.</p>

  <h1>Blog #4</h1>
  <p>The group of people that was identified in this episode of South Park was computer gamers. They were making fun of how computer gaming can be very negitive toward social interactions between kids today. The social issue is that kids today do not have to go outside and talk to other kids in the neighborhood and play a game outside. Now they can sit inside the house and talk to people around the world but not really develop social skills. They critique this by saying that the four kids in South Park develop no life and that anyone who plays the game does not have a life either. They make fun of the fact that when the children of South Park try to beat this one mega-gamer in World of Warcraft they become overwieght and basically have not life outside of playing World of Warcraft. I think that yet this is a stereo type of the average computer gamer. In sure you could find a case as seen in South Park but for most gamers that really is not the case as not all computer gamers are to the extremes that are shown in the video. They do show the social issue which was the kids just played World of Warcraft all day, everyday and did not get any exersize or talk to anyone directly face to face.</p>

  <p>The cultural analysis project is I think an enjoyable one. You can look around and find how technology is really effecting our generation. You can also see some of the problems that come with this technology as well. For instace the smart phone. It is an amazing piece of technology that has become a big use in our daily lives. You can do your work on it, stay connected to people through social media, talk, text, use the internet, play games, etc. It truely is amazing what you can do with these little hand held computers. Yet they do have some problems associated with them. One is that they are effecting the social skills of young teens. It has become so easy to talk to your friends through your phone that face to face interactions are becoming less and less frequent. This has an impact on that persons ability to talk to people that they are not familiar with or even in group senarios. Another problem is that teens are commiting less facts to memory simiply because you could just look it up on your phone if you need to know it again. I know that I do this from time to time as well. It is just so easy to get the information that you want to know through the internet. Now im not saying that this is really a bad thing. It is just that people are committing facts into short term memory instead of long term simply because they could just look it up agian on their phone at anytime.</p>
  <p>Another big topic is violent videogames. Personally I really like to play videogames. In particular shooting games but, I like them all from racing to sprots games. Now there has been a lot of debate over violent videogames and how they are affecting the mind of young kids today. Honestly, some videogames take the violence way over the top and other are not at an extreme level but any of them could have an effect on a childs mind. Some debate that it makes them more likely to be violent, or on the flip side it does not make them more violent because they would do it in a game and not in real life. But when you think about it they do rate the games to try and keep younger kids away from some of the games. Yet they still get a hold of them because thier parents buy it for them. That is the main issue. If parents did not buy it for them then they can not get a hold of them until they meet the age requirement</p>

  <p>The add about Detriot and the chrysler 200 in one with many symbols. The biggest thing that is noticed is the imagery from Detroit. They show detriot for what it is. It is a city that has had its fair share of difficulties. THey show a lot of industry that is in the city. It could symbolize that Detriot is not out of the game yet and is on a comeback. They also show the landmarks of Detriot like the GM buildings and the Fox Theater. They also include the tagline "Imported from Detroit" because today many people are conserned because a lot of what is bought in marketplaces today are imported. This tells you that it was manufactured in America. It also brings a sense of pride to the city because usually when a tag says imported from a counrty. With the tag "Imported from Detroit" It brings out a sense of uniqueness says that this is Detroit the city known for its cars. This is also outlined by the voiceover in the comercial. It is saying how Detroit has been to hell and back. I also says how the hotest fires make the best steel. What it is comparing is that Detriot has been through the fire and now it is the best steel. The best steel is refuring to its manufacturing ability. But it does it in a way that says the car is the final product from this great steel and the car is the best out there because it came from Detroit.</p>

  <p>The formal research project was a great way to get in sight on what my major is all about. My major is going to be mechanical engineering. I knew that it was going to be a hard degree when I told my family what i wanted to be and they looked back and said "good luck". They were right. It has to do with a lot of math an science. Classes like thermodynamics, calculus 1-4, etc. But it also gave me an idea about how the job was preformed. today there is software that can model a robot for instance and tell you how much the robot arm can lift. It will tell you everything you need to know including the stress points. It really is amazing how computers are changing the way that we do things. I read an article about how engieering has changed the work place. It was talking about how because of computers entire departments have been replaced by only a couple of engineers. I really thought that it was really cool and this project really solidified my choice to be an engineer.</p>
  
  <h1>Blog #8</h1>
  <p1>One of the hardest things about creating a research paper is the research itself. You have to go through tons of websites and sources seeing if the information that you find in that website can or will help you to write the conclusion that you are trying to prove or say. It really is a tedious process trying to look through them all. But sometimes you can find that one source that has a ton of information that you can write your while paper off of. Other times you have to use five to six sources to get the same amount of information. It really is the topic and whether or not a lot of information is available on it. But for the most part the longest part of the paper really is the research. Yet it is the longest part of a paper the reseatch that you get can really make or break a paper because the more you have the more proof you have to prove your point on. So in the end game no matter how tedious it is, it really is something that is worth the work. </p1>

  <p>Blogging. Yes i am writing a blog about blogging. I am not very good at it. I really do not know what to write about when ever I get to the page. It really does take me a while to think of things to type. I so far have only been blogging about the writing assignments to keep a record of what I am thinking at that time for the final paper. It should help me with the final paper but you never no maybe i didn't blog enough throughout th class period. I feel like blogging is really just really whatever is on your mind you put it down in your blog. When you think about it that is exactly what I am doing now. I really am indeferent to the idea of blogging too. I just don't really have a nack for this type of thing. Maybe that is because I am an engineer and huminties courses like writing and social sciences are only done because the school requires them. But on another note the information that I am learning most likely will com in handy some where down the road like learning how to change code in Github to create this blog.</p>

  <p>Group projects can be fun. This project requires our group to take on of our earlier projects and make a documentary about it. Group projects are fun and make it easier to distribute the work load around al little so more can get done in a shorter time frame. The one major issue with group projects though is if one of the group members does not pull thier load. That was not the case for my group I thought all of use held up a a equal work load. The main problem with our group was trying to find time to meet. That is another challenging part of group work is trying to find a time where everyone can meet up. But when we do we are very efficent with our time and get things done good and quickly. So I think that this group project should be one that will move very smoothly. </p>

  <p>The remix project was a cool project. We got to take one of our papers that we wrote earlier in the year and make a documentary out of it. It was kind of a challenging project because it was hard to find time to get the group together. Everyone has thier differnet class schedules as after school activities as well. But once we found a time to meet we worked very efficently and got what needed to be done finsihed. It was fun making the video and when it came together I really liked it. It has a lot of really good information in it. It also makes you think of your daily routine and how much you really do use your phone all the time. I thought that it was really crazy some of the things that smartphones are causing. Some people get so addicted to thier phones that when they do not have it for more then a day they can begin to show withdrawl symptoms. It really is amazing the impact that the small phones have on use as we just walk through our daily lives. </p>
  
  <h1>Blog #12</h1>
  <p>The last project is finally upon use and classes are winding down. It is hard to believe that there really only is three weeks of classes left and then comes finals week. There definitly is a lot of work that needs to be done before a=I can finish out the semester and have the whole summer off of school. It also feels like school is not over by a longshot on the manner that this is my first year of college and in highschool the summer did not start till end of the first week of June and now I am getting out in the first couple days of May. Summer is going to feel like it will go on forever and I really do not have a problem with that at all. It is just crazy to think that my first year of college is almost done with and I have three more years of schooling left to go. Then I get to work for the next 35-40 years of my life where their is no summer vacations so that just makes me that much more happy that the summer will feel so much longer.</p>
  
  <h1>Blog #13</h1>
  <p>The course retrospect project is kind of a odd project I think. That is mainly because I am really not sure what to write for the paper part of it. Am I just suppost to write about what the papers are about and type of assignments assigned, or am I jsut going to talk about what to do in he course to get a good grade. It really does not say what it wants specifically so I am going to write about what I think it means and revise my paper through the peer review groups and the comments that my classmates leave me. It still is a old idea thinking that the school year is almost done with. It feels like it flew by so fast and I guess time really does fly by quickly when you are having fun. With how fast the year flew by I guess I was having a lot of fun.</p>
  
  <h1>Blog #14</h1>
  <p>The remix project group part is also very confusing on the material that we are suppost to put up on the website. So far I have not really met anyone in my group and am wondering what content we need to gather. It realy could be anything. Do we just talk about the assignment and give them a guide on what to do for that assignment or are we jsut supposed to that a whole bunch of papers that the class wrote this year and put them up in the specific tabs for the projects. Or are we supposted to both I really have no idea. I guess next Monday I will have to try and gather the group together so that way we can talk out what we need and how to do all of the work in a week before the webpage is due on the day of the final. This does also count for our final so this project is very important to our grade and can not really be taken lightly. SO until Monday I really am not sure where to go or what to do.</p>
  
  <h1>Blog #15</h1>
  <p>Well here it is this is my last blog for the school year and the class is at its end point. I have done it all now all that is left is to finish my last project and turn it in the day of the final. I have been through it all I have gone through five projects, the homework activities, codecademy, and the blogs with my head above water along with the remainder of my classes this spring semester. All that is left is to study take my finals and then relax over the long summer and make some money at my summer job. Then in August I gt to prepare to do it all over again this time with harder classes then the last semester. I will have a new roomate and a new dorm. Soon it will all start over again and then stress of school wil be back but I still have a long summer to hang out and chill before the chaos begins again and for that I hope the summer does not fly in a flash but takes its time.</p>
