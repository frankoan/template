			<h1>Research Section</h1>
			<p>Research and technology are also intertwine in the manner that projects are not taking large steps forward but taking steps in shorter strides in creating new technology. This allows for surprisingly a faster developmental process because it allows engineers to make shorter strides and use technology available to them at the time of the start of development in there project. This allows the company or engineer to take that technology and adapt it to the project but he can also improve it. Research is being done like this mainly because companies are focused on the reliability of the product. This is a big issue because if your product is not reliable then you have to replace the old on costing money but also if you do not put out a reliable product you lose future business. This is the reason why companies research in shorter steps because when you take large jumps your product has a better chance at failing (Bar-Cohen). Even in other fields research at the college level is fast as well. According to Laura Hirsh who is a student at Oregon looking to get a PhD in Chemical engineering said the “research has been sped up with the use of new technologies” and that it is also changing the ways “classes are taught as new technologies arise they make need to adapt the school curriculum to the changing times.” </p>
