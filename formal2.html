			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Every student in college has a chosen major that he/she wants to get a degree in. As schooling goes on they may change their mind about what major to pick and switch. My chosen major is in the field of engineering, specifically mechanical engineering. Engineering is a field that is very broad and for the most part much of everything that you touch has been designed by an engineer. For instance the program that I am using to write this paper was created by a computer science engineer. The keys that I am typing are made out of plastic that was synthesized by a chemical engineer. Finally, the circuits and transistors that are sending each key strike to the processor were created by an electrical engineer. But what really is an engineer. An engineer is someone who designs, maintains, or builds engines, public works, or machines. Now the field of engineering is a very large field with many opportunities and many different specializations. For instance there are aerospace, chemical, computer, electrical, mechanical and so on each with its own specific branch of study. Each also has its own set of characteristics that differentiate the degrees but at the same time have many commonalities with the other fields of study. In this paper, I will talk about engineering as both a whole and get into my chosen field of engineering. I will talk about the schooling in the degree, the type of communication that takes place in that field, and how technology is affecting both the work place and communication through it.</p>
