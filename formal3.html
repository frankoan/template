			<p><Mechanical engineering is a degree that you can really do a lot with and has a lot of job openings. Basically if it moves then a mechanical engineer had something to do with it. They are used in almost every field, from automotive, to aerospace, to industrial, to navel, etc. all use mechanical engineers. Mechanical engineering is also a degree that pays a healthy life style with a median salary recorded in 2012 of about 80,580. The median salary has also been rising since 2004 and is still expected to climb due to the high demand for the degree. The high end of the scale can make upwards of 120,000 and the low end salaries going no lower than 52,000 (Edleson).  The light green line of the chart first chart above shows the median salary. The dark green line shows salaries compensated for inflation. The chart shows how the salaries have skyrocketed over the last decade.  The second chart shows the rise in demand for mechanical engineers over the last decade as the number of engineers employed grew./p>
			<p>Engineering is one of those degrees where if you tell someone you want to be an engineer they pat you on the back and say “good luck”. If it was easy then everyone would be an engineer but that is not the case. This is because they know that the schooling path is one that is very tough and really focuses on mathematics and sciences. For the most part engineering students will have to take math all the way up to calculus four which is differential equations. As for other classes it really depends on the specific field that you are entering. For my specific field of mechanical engineering it mostly deals with mathematic, physics, thermodynamics, materials science, etc. These classes are also paired with general education classes that are required by the university. The work load is quite a lot and gets harder with each passing semester. But the biggest advice that I have gotten from older classmen is to put your head down and get as much as possible done on your weekdays so you can have a free day on the weekend. On the other hand for as much as engineering is focused on mathematics and the sciences, it also focuses on creativity. They encourage engineering students to be creative in how they do their homework and push their students to go outside the ordinary. They want you to think of ways to take a simple piece of technology and redesign it to fit a new purpose. They push creativity because you have to think outside the box as an engineer. This is because engineers solve problems in society and create new technologies that push the bounds of common thought. This is because the most renowned engineers are those that saw the impossible and made it possible. </p>
