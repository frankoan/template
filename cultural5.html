			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Some ways that could help prevent this is really on the user of the phone himself/herself. They could help correct this by not having these disconnected conversations with their friends. They could attempt to talk face to face more often.  While in school, attempt to always create new conversations with the people around you. This will help you get used to talking to people that you do not know taking away the awkwardness and overall allowing you to have more friends but do better in the work place as you will not always know your clients, boss, interviewer, etc.  Another proposed solution would be to limit the amount of time that someone could be on a social media app or in general on their phone per day. This will force kids to become more social as once you hit the limit you could make it so they can only call their parents or emergency services just in case something goes wrong.</p>
			<p>Some fixes for changing the way we memorize facts better could be to not allow students to use their phones at any point in the class. Another could be to design tests that will force students to use the information multiple times forcing them to put it in long term memory. Teachers could also use homework to their advantage and create it in a way that is not more time consuming to the student but force them to memorize the facts and main points at a deeper level. </p>
