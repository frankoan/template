			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this paper is to address the social issues that are attached to current and even future smart phones. Current smart phones are amazing pieces of technology that can be used by just about anyone. They are very simple and are basically a hand held computer that you can call and text people with. You can easily stay connected with people around the world through these devices. But with all of these benefits comes some consequences.  One of these consequences is not talking to people directly.  Another is the way you remember information. This one of the main issues that is being connected to smart phone usage is the decline in social skills between teenagers. This is happening because of the number of apps that you can talk to people and yet not have any face to face interaction with them. My position on this social issue is that they are causing a negative effect on the social skills. They are creating a way to allow kids to talk to each other through their phones but not actually communicating in a face to face manner.  The other is that they are not committing learned information in school to long term memory, because they can look it up again on their phone. One possible solution would be to communicate face to face through youâ€™re your smart phone. This does not cause a decrease in phone usage but it will create an increase in face to face communication and helping you develop the necessary social skills. For the second issue, it would be to change way information is taught.</p>
