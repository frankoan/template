		<p>In composing this documentary we choose the issue of smartphones and their usage and addiction to them. This issue affected how we composed our material in the manner that we had to look at smartphone usage in both around use and even our own to try and encompass the issue. This actually helped use better understand the issue because when researching the topic we found that some of the issues regarding smartphone usage we were subconsciously doing. It also made use a where of what was happening around you. Like when you go into the cafeteria you can look around and see tons of people on their phones even in groups. Even in class when people check their phones every five to ten minutes. Some problems that came around organizing and composing our documentary was one finding a camera that we could use. We did get one but for the most part it was recorded on our smartphones. Another problem that came up was finding time where we could all meet up to group our collected data together. Meetings where necessary to plan out the rest of the project and to keep everyone on the same page.  The role that audience played was one the audience watching will realize what they do that are the problems with the usage. Other things was that the people around use we used as examples to show how often smartphones are used. </p>
		<p>We selected the issue from the cultural analysis projects that our group had done. They decided to pick mine because it was a very well-known issue about how people are becoming addicted to their phones. The most challenging part of the project for me was the planning of the documentary. It was trying to figure out what was going to be needed and how to break it up evenly between the other group members. But everyone was very cooperative and once we got our plan it came together quickly. We did kind of take a systematic approach to this. We first got our proposals done and out of the way. We then planned interviews and what information should be put in the documentary. Once that was done we took all of that information together and made the documentary. </p>
		<p>The most beneficial resource to use was a study that I had referenced in my cultural analysis paper it was a study taken from the European Journal of Scientific Research called Impact of Smartphones on Society by Muhammad Sarwar and Tariq Rahim Soomro. It had tons of facts regarding smartphones evolution and usage. This consisted of both the positive impacts but it also had all of the negative impacts that smartphones were having on society. Another was looking at peopleâ€™s behavior and how they used their phones. The ones that were least beneficial where magazine articles that talk about the issue but they are very opinionated so it was hard to really use them in our documentary. </p>
		<p> The group interaction was very good I thought. Everyone was very social able and we were able to split up the work evenly. Everyone showed up to the meetings and where ready to work as soon as everyone arrived. Everyone did their parts that they were supposed to do well and everything really fell into place very quickly. I liked working in a group environment outside of the usual single person projects that we did for the first half of class. It was enjoyable because I was a chance to talk with people in the class. Group work can be a better experience but it can mean more work just because you have to keep everyone in the group informed about what is happening and when we are meeting so communication is key.  But all in all I thought it was a fruitful experience.</p>
		<p>I thought that we planned out this project well. We really did not take the whole project on at once so we just made goals. Our goals usually were to complete one piece of the project at a time. This way we could focus strongly to the thing at hand and worry about the other parts later allowing us to do the at hand work with the whole group and then move on to the next part. If given a chance to do it again we would probably change the meeting times or just work on it in class when time was given. </p>
		<p>The documentary is most effective in the way that the information is given to you in a way that creates a climax near the end of the video and it really makes you think about how you use your phone and are you addicted to your phone.  We made them as a group when we started to gather the information we would think of good ways to give it to the audience in a manner that would hook them to the documentary. </p>
