			<h1>Communication Section</h1>
			<p>Even though creativity is very important in engineering the most important area to an engineer working today is that of communication. Communication is extremely important to how well a company can run efficiently. It is becoming very well known that in the field of “engineering, or any other technical field, the need for strong communication skills increases every day. (Corrello, 4)” This is because the field of engineering is a vary team oriented job in the work place. For the most part every company has their engineers working in teams to complete the task at hand. This creates a great need to be able to communicate effectively to the members of your team and other teams if necessary. Most engineers communicate electronically or face-to-face interactions. But the type of communication is not very creative. It is very technical and straight to the point. There really is not very much room to write a very long report to a supervisor on the product being developed. For the most part reports are very technical and are focused on what information needs to be passed on usually in the form of a memo to supervisors or other team members. The engineers want to know exactly how the product tested and what is needed to fix that product if corrections are needed. For the most part that is the basis of communication. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, communication in the field of engineering just is not between other members in your group but with other areas within the company or with the customer. Mainly they communicated part specifications and requirements as well as conducted memos one the continual progress of the project. For the most part communication is one of the biggest tasks that an engineer does. According to a survey conducted by Vest, Long, and Anderson in 1996 consisted of 243 electrical engineers from around the nation. The results that they came back with, was that 58 percent of the time on average out of each work day was spent on communicating with employees (Corrello, 11). This large portion of the day spend on communication has to mainly due with the continuously shortening windows to finish products. This requires a great deal of communication between all parts of the company, as well as each employee to create a smooth process to create a finished product within the given time frame.</p>
			<p>With a large need to focus on technical communication between coworkers a new large demand has been placed on colleges that require communication skills to be taught in engineering courses. This is to get new engineers comfortable working in groups and the ability to communicate within the assigned group effectively. Colleges are meeting this requirement by requiring engineers to take communication classes such as social science classes or writing classes. These classes will further help students create the necessary skills needed to be ready and able to communicate smoothly within a team. Colleges are designing curriculum that puts students into teams and then assigning them a project to complete. Their grade then depends on how well they complete the project at hand. To add communication skills to the project to get students used to communicating within groups and writing of technical reports on the given assignment.</p>
			<p>Communication and team skills are also being pushed because they are finding a direct correlation between an engineer’s communication skills and his position within the company. This is proven because for one if an engineer does not have good interview skills he cannot obtain the desired position. On another note, it can create a problem for one’s problem solving skills as the problem could not be fully communicated to someone. For mid- level engineers who are leading teams with poor communication skills can cause poor production efficiency as information does not flow throughout the workplace on the given tasks at hand (Corrello, 14). </p>
			<p>One of the main reasons why communication is becoming more and more important to engineering is because of the amount of change technology has had on the workplace. If we went back in time to a company in the mid-60s you would find everything to be very different. For instance the company would contain large room called drafting room but to the engineers they were called the bullpens. Within that room would be a large main frame computer that now your cellphone could put to shame in computing power. Back in this time the time required for each project was a lot longer than it was today. Back then project deadlines were for the most part 6 years for cars and mainframe computers, today that has now been compressed in to two years. For other smaller projects the time frame is even shorter with most deadlines being in the range on only six months. This is due to the large steps that technology has taken in the last 30 years. Today the large engineering bullpens of the past are gone and with them entire departments have been condensed into just a small team of engineers. Today some engineers are not even practicing but instead telecommunicating (Bar-Cohen).</p>
			<p>With these shorter deadlines comes the need for product design to be very smooth with little problems arising as there really is not much time to fix a large problem. This is why communication is becoming more and more important in the field of engineering to create that smooth process. Technology has also affected the way they communicate. Engineers today send most of the communication electronically through email and other sources. This allows for quick back and forth communication outside of a face-to-face interaction. This will also allow them to get involved with the customer no matter the distance. This will help the engineers understand the qualities that the customer wants in the product at hand. It can also allow for customer feedback on the product and if necessary change demands and specifications with speed (Corrello, 11). Also according to my father David Franko who has a degree as an industrial Engineer and a MBA works as a project manager for a company that gets contracts from around the world. He says that technology has really made it easy to talk to clients. “Using simple software like ‘go to meeting’ allows us to talk to the client half way around the world, and gives us the opportunity to show the client the product and the client can share his concerns about it with us.” </p>
