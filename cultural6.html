			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>For social skills these are some fixes that could work if implemented. Whether it was self-discipline or your phone becomes locked after a certain amount of time they will work forcing kids to talk more outside of texting and social media. Will a phone every have a lock feature like that, it really is unlikely to think so but it would help to solve the problem.  The first solution really is something that you will have to do on your own and depends on how well your will can hold out. Both solutions though if implemented would force kids to talk more with one another and increase their social skills.</p>
			<p>These solutions for memory would have an effect on the way students memorize material and the more programs are designed around converting new information and turning it into long term memory the better off students will be in school. This will also decrease the amount of use the student uses his smart phone for information. </p>
